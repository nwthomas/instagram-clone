# Instagram Clone

As both one of the most popular social media sites on the planet as well as a rising star at the moment, Instagram is a unique combination of photo posts, text, and stories.

Due to this, I built a clone as a way to showcase React and Sassy CSS (SCSS) as well as to build an interesting portfolio piece. Although you are not required to login with a specific username, you will find that the login functionality is otherwise present and fun to use. I hope you enjoy my work!
